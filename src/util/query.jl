# util/query.jl — programmatic read-oriented API for DataVault databases
#
# High-level primitives for discovering and attaching to previously written
# studies. Built on top of log.toml discovery (see util/log_toml.jl).
#
# Typical usage from an analysis / figure script:
#
#     for study in DataVault.open_all(outdir)
#         study.info.project_name == "linear_response" || continue
#         for key in DataVault.keys(study.vault; status=:done)
#             data = DataVault.load(study.vault, key)
#             # plot / analyze
#         end
#     end
#
# Attached vaults are normal writable `Vault`s: attaching effectively
# re-registers the current DataVault version with the existing log.toml.
# This lets you seamlessly resume computation — `mark_done!`, `save!`,
# `build_ledger`, etc. all work on attached vaults.

    AttachedStudy

A bundle of (`vault`, log.toml `info`, `log_path`) produced by `open_all`.
Iterate over these to process every study under an outdir.

"""
    attach(log_path) -> Vault
    attach(outdir; project, run="default") -> Vault

Attach to a previously written (study, run) and return a `Vault`.

The first form takes the absolute path to a `log.toml` file directly.
The second form uses the frozen discovery contract — given an `outdir`,
a `project` name, and a `run` name, it resolves the log.toml at
`{outdir}/.datavault/{project}/{run}.log.toml` and attaches to it.
The two forms are distinguished by whether `project` is supplied.

Config resolution order:
  1. `{outdir}/{layout.config_snapshot}` — the frozen snapshot taken at
     initial construction; preferred because it is stable under moves and
     is colocated with the data.
  2. `log.toml[study].config` — the original absolute path recorded at
     construction; used as a fallback with a warning.
  3. Error if neither is available.

The returned `Vault` is fully writable. Its constructor will idempotently
upsert the log.toml, refreshing `[meta].datavault_version` and
`datavault_git_hash`. `created_at` is preserved.

as warnings and skipped so that iteration over a partially-corrupted
outdir still yields the healthy studies.

Read `ledger.csv` for this vault's (study, run) and return it as a vector
of row dicts (`column_name => string_value`). Returns `Dict{String,String}[]`
if the ledger file does not exist or is empty.

Values are returned as strings; callers are responsible for type
conversion. The parser assumes DataVault's output format (simple
comma-separated, no quoting, no embedded commas).

latest `.done` files.

Aggregate every ledger under `outdir` into a single flat sequence of row

columns prepended conceptually (the dict is unordered):

  - `project_name`
  - `run`
  - `datavault_version`
  - `log_toml` (outdir-relative path to the originating log.toml)

Studies whose ledger.csv does not yet exist contribute zero rows but are
still attached (their metadata appears via `open_all` if you want both).

For cross-outdir aggregation (e.g. scanning a whole Vault tree), call
this per outdir and concatenate — DataVault itself is intentionally
unaware of any higher-level layout like Vault's `apps/lib/dev` layers.
