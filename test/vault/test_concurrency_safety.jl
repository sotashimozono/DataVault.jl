test_concurrency_safety.jl — concurrency / robustness fixes

- `save!` uses a per-task tmp name, so concurrent writers to one key in the
  same process can't `mv` each other's half-written tmp file (corruption).
- a future-dated heartbeat never yields a negative age, so NFS clock skew can't
  make a `.running` lock look perpetually fresh (immortal / never reclaimable).
- `ledger.csv` quotes cells, so a comma in `tag_value` round-trips instead of
  shifting every later column.
